IP - Internet Protocol, every internet working device has a IP
 - number.number.number.number
when sending packages there is a sorce adress and a destination adress to which it is going 
soruces adress + delivery adress

IP alone is not enough to guarantee delivery, ex router is overwelmed - recieving too many pacages and drop some pacages
TCP - used with conjunction with IP - guarantees delivery
soruces adress + delivery adress + sequence number + port number

another feautre is ports - expalining the type of of data here in

port numbers:
- 80 HTTP
- 443 HTTPS

TCP is the pair of protocols that the internet uses to get data form pont A to pont 
TCP guarantees delivery with sequence number and helps the servers do more than one thing
